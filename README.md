# Generate Secure Passphrase

## Description

I have modified the provided starter code to create a browser-based application that generates randomized passwords based on user-selected criteria. This application is powered by JavaScript and can be accessed through a web browser.


## Installation
This is a browser-based application. The code consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: Contains the structure of the webpage.
- `Develop/style.css`: Provides styling for the webpage.
- `Develop/script.js`: Implements the interactivity of the app.



## Usage

Feel free to use this code as a starter for your own webpage. You can customize the design by modifying the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

Visit the [deployed webpage](https://bazrahimi.github.io/secure-passphrase/) to see the live version.
